abstract = {The highly anticipated 5G mmWave technology promises to enable many uplink-oriented, latency-critical applications (LCAs) such as Augmented Reality and Connected Autonomous Vehicles. Nonetheless, recent measurement studies have largely focused on its downlink performance. In this work, we perform a systematic study of the uplink performance of commercial 5G mmWave networks across 3 major US cities and 2 mobile operators. Our study makes three contributions. (1) It reveals that 5G mmWave uplink performance is geographically diverse, substantially higher over LTE in terms of bandwidth and latency, but often erratic and suboptimal, which can degrade LCA performance. (2) Our analysis of control messages and PHY-level KPIs shows that the root causes for the suboptimal performance are fundamental to 5G mmWave and cannot be easily fixed via simple tuning of network configurations. (3) We identify various design and deployment optimizations that 5G operators can explore to bring 5G mmWave performance to the level needed to ultimately support the LCAs.},

abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) has been widely hailed as a representative of ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency apps that will be enabled by 5G networks. While single-user AR can perform AR tasks locally on the mobile device, multi-user AR apps, which allow multiple users to interact within the same physical space, critically rely on the cellular network to support user interactions. However, a recent study showed that multi-user AR apps can experience very high end-to-end latency when running over LTE, rendering user interaction practically infeasible. In this paper, we study whether 5G mmWave, which promises significant bandwidth and latency improvements over LTE, can support multi-user AR by conducting an in-depth measurement study of the same popular multi-user AR app over both LTE and 5G mmWave.",

abstract = {Edge-assisted Augmented Reality (AR) which offloads compute-intensive Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based AR tasks to edge servers faces an important design challenge: how to pick the DNN model out of many choices proposed for each AR task for offloading. For each AR task, e.g., depth estimation, many DNN-based models have been proposed over time that vary in accuracy and complexity. In general, more accurate models are also more complex; they are larger and have longer inference time. Thus choosing a larger model in offloading can provide higher accuracy for the offloaded frames but also incur longer turnaround time, during which the AR app has to reuse the estimation result from the last offloaded frame, which can lead to lower average accuracy.In this paper, we experimentally study this design tradeoff using depth estimation as a case study. We design optimal offloading schedule and further consider the impact of numerous factors such as on-device fast tracking, frame downsizing and available network bandwidth. Our results show that for edge-assisted monocular depth estimation, with proper frame downsizing and fast tracking, compared to small models, the improved accuracy of large models can offset its longer turnaround time to provide higher average estimation accuracy across frames under both LTE and 5G mmWave.},
