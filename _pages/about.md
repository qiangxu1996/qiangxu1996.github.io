I am a last-year Ph.D. student in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Y. Charlie Hu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ychu/). I am interested in mobile systems, edge computing, and their intersection with machine learning. My recent research focuses on building efficient machine learning inference systems for emerging applications like augmented reality. I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.

I will be joining [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a Developer Technology Engineer in the summer of 2024.
