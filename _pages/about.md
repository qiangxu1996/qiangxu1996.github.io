I am a Developer Technology Engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/). I am interested in mobile systems, edge computing, and their intersection with machine learning. My recent research focuses on building efficient machine learning inference systems for emerging applications like augmented reality and large language models. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Y. Charlie Hu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ychu/). I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.
